# LinkedIn Post Template for Calorie Tracker App

## Option 1: Technical Focus

```
🚀 Just built an AI-powered calorie tracking app!

Wanted to learn React Native and AI integration, so I built something I'd actually use.

✨ Key Features:
📸 Snap a photo → AI identifies food & estimates calories
🔥 Streak tracking for consistency
📊 Real-time macro tracking (protein/carbs/fats)
⚡ One-tap quick logging for favorites
🎯 Fully customizable goals

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• React Native + Expo (mobile)
• Python FastAPI (backend)
• Google Gemini Vision AI
• Supabase (PostgreSQL)
• TypeScript

The hardest part? Getting the camera-to-AI pipeline working smoothly and handling edge cases when the AI couldn't identify food.

## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

```
🎯 Built a smarter way to track calories

Tired of manually searching food databases and estimating portions, so I built an app that does it for me.

How it works:
1. Take a photo of your food
2. AI analyzes and estimates nutrition
3. Log it with one tap
4. Track your progress

Built with:
React Native • Python • Google Gemini AI • Supabase

40+ hours from concept to working prototype.

Code is open source on GitHub! [link]

## Option 3: Learning Journey

```
From idea to app in 2 weeks 📱

Project: AI-powered calorie tracker
Goal: Learn React Native & AI integration

What I built:
✅ Camera-based food recognition
✅ AI nutrition estimation (Gemini Vision)
✅ Real-time tracking dashboard
✅ Streak system for motivation
✅ Full onboarding flow

What I learned:
• React Native navigation & animations
• Integrating vision AI models
• Building REST APIs with FastAPI
• Mobile-first design patterns
• State management in React Native

Biggest challenge: Making the AI accurate enough to be useful while having graceful fallbacks.

The app is fully functional and code is on GitHub.

Building in public - what features would you add?
